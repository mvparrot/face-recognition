  "body": "### Project Overview\r\nTennis superstar and Grand Slam champion Venus Williams has said that \"Tennis is mostly mental. You win or lose the match before you even go out there.\" \r\n\r\nMany tennis professionals share the idea that tennis is largely a mental game, yet little is known about the mental side of tennis. Facial expressions during competition provide the most direct insight into a player's thoughts during. The aim of this project is to begin to develop methods to collect accurate information about the facial expressions of elite tennis athletes during matchplay.\r\n\r\n### Project Goals\r\nThe student who undertakes this project will test how well currently available facial recognition software performs at identifying faces of the two players in a tennis match. This project will involve coding tennis matches for faces, applying the facial recognition software, and performing statistical analyses to determine the software's performance accuracy. Analyses will be performed in the R language and a final report describing the analyses and findings will be written in R markdown.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nThis project is intended for a student who is an experienced R programmer and has had an introductory statistics course.\r\n\r\n### Supervisors\r\n\r\nThe project will be supervised by Professor Di Cook (@dicook) from Monash University and Stephanie Kovalchik (@skoval), a Research Fellow at Victoria University and tennis data scientist at Tennis Australia.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nFor inquiries and questions, please contact <dicook@monash.edu> or <stephanie.kovalchik@vu.edu.au>.\r\n",

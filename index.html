    <p> Recognising faces of tennis athletes during competition. We are starting work to extract information about mood and emotion of tennis players during matches. As part of this work, we are interested in seeing how well  available facial recognition software performs on video of tennis matches. So this project would involve a small detection study where a student would code actual matches for faces, run facial reg software on the same matches, and test how well the software detects faces.
